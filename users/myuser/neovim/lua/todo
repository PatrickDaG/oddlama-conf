keybinds:
- comment.nvim
- smarter keybinds for surround, e.g. "" on word --> "word", same for '', maybe others.
- lsp keybinds
- move block of lines
- m to surround
- dressing make larger



- maybe install pynvim and npm neovim on update
- nice wrapping behavior g<up> g<down>, setlocal linebreak, setlocal wrap, setlocal showbreak=\| \ \ \ , setlocal breakindent
- when set wrap, have an alternative V and ctrlV that behave like the text was actually that way.


- mundo
- easyalign

- nvim dap (some kind of debugger pls)

- (link still applise= nvim cmp can kill nvim by completing /dev/ and going over stdin whoops.
- long opening times when opening paper.jar
- remove ZZ shortcut
- converter: number <-> hex <-> oct <-> ...; camelcase pascalcase snakecase
- gJ but delete every trailing and leading space, maybe gdJ
- button to jump to end of match under cursor NOT in visual mode
- visual mode f --> vf" should mark to next "
- v......s<esc> sometimes jumps back some characters which makes inital cursor movement strange. subst shouldnt move cursor from beginning if characters are deleted or ever like noooooop
- multi search highlight with different color.
- make ctrl-shift-cv copy/insert things from * buffer
- maybe an IDE init button like <F9>. before that only minimal plugins loaded, e.g. no completion no tabnine nothing too obstrusive and nothing that is slow on large arbitarary files.
- textobject for "current functino parameter like ciw -> cip
- multuple cursors on each line, then trigger completion, but allow two modes. either only first cursor gets completion, others get same completion,
  or all cursors complete separately and take the first completion by themselves.
- key for Crtl+[] for jump back and select in help
- indent blankline error: when searching for a word, and a indentline begins in the next line such that it is under the first char of the marked word, the blankline will be visually marked too.
- automacros: always record a macro when esc is pressed until esc is pressed again. Begin recording only on first actual action i.e. movement doesnt count before recording, only after starting -> things like Js<del><Esc> will become a repeat sequence yay.
- after nvimcmp replaced text, goto end of this text.
- search and replace "popup" or maybe just prefilled cmdline with interactive search visuals
- whitespace
- indentline
- tabline for TABS not buffer :/
- nvim-tree: a = create new in (selected folder if cursor is hovering over one, else current folder), A = create new in current folder regardless of cursor pos
- lsp
- colored parens
- git
- whitespace marker lines also in NvoimTree
- show bad whitespace
- markdown? latex?
- highlight current line in more lighter cola
- Create a virtualenv specifically for Nvim and use `g:python3_host_prog`.  This will avoid the need to install the pynvim module in each virtualenv.


fast:
- delete ; at end of each line
- align on =
- align function arguments
